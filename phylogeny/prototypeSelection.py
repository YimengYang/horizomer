Prototype selection

Given a set of n elements (S) and their pairwise distances in terms of a
skbio distance matrix (DM) and a given number (k << n), find the sub-set (s)
consisting of exactly k elements, such that s best represents the full set S.

Here, we define "best represents" as maximizing the sum of distances between
all points, i.e. sum {over a,b in S} DM[a,b]. This is our objective function.

This problem is known to be NP-hard [1], thus we need to resort to heuristics.
In the future, this module will implement several heuristics, whose quality can
be measured by the objective function for each problem instance, since there is
no global winner.
For completeness, the exact but exponential algorithm is implemented, too.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dm: skbio.stats.distance.DistanceMatrix
        pairwise distances for all elements in the full set S.
        Must be symmetric and non-hollow.
    num_prototypes: int
        Number of prototypes to select for distance matrix.
        Must be >= 2, since a single prototype is useless.
        Must be smaller than the number of elements in the distance matrix,

    max_combinations_to_test: int
        The maximal number of combinations to test. If exceeding, the function
        declines execution.

    -------
    sequence of str
        A sequence holding selected prototypes, i.e. a sub-set of the

        The number of prototypes to be found should be at least 2 and at most
        one element smaller than elements in the distance matrix. Otherwise, a

    Notes
    -----
    This is the reference implementation for an exact algorithm for the
    prototype selection problem. It has an exponential runtime and will only
    operate on small instances (< max_combinations_to_test).
    Idea: test all (n over k) combinations of selecting k elements from n with-
          out replacement. Compute the objective for each such combination and
          report the combination with maximal value.

       Prototype selection is NP-hard. This is an implementation of a greedy
