### WGS-HGT
Workflow for detecting genome-wide horizontal gene transfers.

This package contains code for the Distance-Method HGT detection algorithm,
a benchmark for running phylogenetic, homology search and parametric software
for HGT detection and the final workflow consisting of a subset of the
benchmarked tools and intermediate steps for genome-wide HGT detection.
