def walk_copy(node, src):
    """Directionally and recursively copy a tree node and its neighbors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    node : skbio.TreeNode
        node and its neighbors to be copied
    src : skbio.TreeNode
        an upstream node determining the direction of walking (src -> node)

    Returns
    -------
    skbio.TreeNode
        copied node and its neighbors

    Notes
    -----
    After manipulation, `src` will become the parent of `node`, and all other
    neighbors of `node` will become children of it.

    Unlike scikit-bio's `unrooted_copy` function, this function has special
    treatment at root: For an unrooted tree, its "root" will be retained as a
    regular node; for a rooted tree, its root will be deleted, and all basal
    nodes will become immediate children of the basal node where the source is
    located.

    The function determines whether a tree is rooted or unrooted in such way:
    rooted: root has two children; unrooted: root has one or more than two
    children.

    Logic (pseudocode):
    if node is root:
        if tree is rooted:
            raise error
        else:
            if src in node.children:
